# Python Installation on Windows

The recommended way to install Python on Windows is using the official installer.

1.  Go to the [Python Downloads for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) page.
2.  Download the latest stable "Windows installer (64-bit)" or "Windows installer (32-bit)" depending on your system architecture.
3.  Run the downloaded `.exe` file.
4.  **Important:** Make sure to check the box that says "**Add Python X.Y to PATH**" during the installation process. This will allow you to run Python from the command prompt.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
